# Generation and Solving of a 3D Maze using Unitys ML Agents

Welcome to the Maze Generation and Maze Solving project repository. This collaborative project explores the creation of agents capable of generating intricate mazes and solving them.

## Project Overview

In collaboration, Faye Bullwinkel and Vivienne Drongowski approached the challenge from two different angles:

### Maze Generation

- Vivienne Drongowski's part of the project focuses on the creation of an agent capable of generating complex mazes.
- Explore the Maze Generation code in [Maze Generation folder](/Assets/Scripts/MazeGeneration_vivi).
- Find more detailed information in [Project report](/Reports/Vivienne_Drongowski_Independent_Coursework_01.pdf).

### Maze Solving

- Faye Bullwinkel's contribution involves an agent that attempts to solve mazes.
- Find the Maze Solving code in [Maze Solving folder](/Assets/Scripts/MazeSolving_Faye).
- Read about further information in [Project report](/Reports/Faye_Bullwinkel_Independent_Coursework_01.pdf).
